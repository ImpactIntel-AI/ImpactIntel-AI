## About Me

Iâ€™m a data scientist with a strong background in Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability, and Learning (MEAL). I specialize in using data-driven tools to track impact, improve decision-making, and design evidence-based solutions in humanitarian and development contexts.

With experience across South Sudan, Kenya, and the Middle East (including Iran), I bring a unique blend of field expertise and technical know-how to every project.
